## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it privately.

### Private Reporting (Preferred)

Please use GitHub's **[Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://github.com/kleinbem/github-config/security/advisories/new)** feature.
This allows us to discuss the issue securely without exposing it to the public.

1. Go to the "Security" tab of the repository.
2. Click "Report a vulnerability".
3. Fill out the details.

### Alternative

If you cannot use GitHub Reporting, please contact the maintainer directly via their public email listed on their GitHub profile.
